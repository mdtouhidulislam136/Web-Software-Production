## Description
In this project we are going to make bus/train timetable app. 

Transit is your real-time urban travel companion. Navigate your cityâ€™s transport system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request an Uber, Ola, or grab the closest bikeshare.
